Task A: Appointment Timeslot Recommender (Stub)
In this lab, you will design and implement an Appointment Slot Recommender using an LLM assistant as your primary programming collaborator. You are asked to implement a Python module that recommends available meeting slots within a defined working window. The system must:
•	Accept working hours (start and end time).
•	Accept a list of existing busy intervals.
•	Accept a required meeting duration.
•	Accept an optional buffer time between meetings.
•	Optionally restrict suggestions to a candidate time window.
•	Return chronologically ordered appointment slots that satisfy all constraints.
The system must ensure that:
•	Suggested slots fall within working hours.
•	Suggested slots do not overlap busy intervals.
•	Buffer time is respected when evaluating availability.
•	Output ordering is deterministic under identical inputs.
The module must preserve the following invariants:
•	Returned slots must be at least as long as the required duration.
•	No returned slot may violate buffer constraints.
•	The returned list must reflect the current system state.
The system must correctly handle non-trivial scenarios such as:
•	Adjacent busy intervals.
•	Very small gaps between meetings.
•	Buffers eliminating otherwise valid availability.
•	Overlapping or unsorted busy intervals.
•	A meeting duration longer than any available gap.
•	No availability within the working window.
The output consists of the next N valid appointment suggestions in chronological order.
